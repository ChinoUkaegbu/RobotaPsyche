(Rough Draft, not edited)

Character names - zoinks, jinkies, jeepers (inspired by the Scooby Doo character catchphrases lol)
No predator-prey system so they die as a result of natural factors e.g. exposure to sunlight? lack of food
The zoinks hunger level should increase faster than the others
Or maybe jeepers could be the predators
OMG wait I could do the incubator thing where like zoinks and jinkies could either like reproduce within themselves or like a cross between zoinks and jinkies
