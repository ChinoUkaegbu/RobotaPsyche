(Rough Draft, not edited)

Character names - zoinks, jinkies, jeepers (inspired by the Scooby Doo character catchphrases lol) and then "food".

No predator-prey system so they die as a result of natural factors e.g. exposure to sunlight? lack of food

The zoinks hunger level should increase faster than the others

Or maybe jeepers could be the predators

Alright, I could do the incubator thing where like zoinks and jinkies could either like reproduce within themselves or like a cross between zoinks and jinkies...zinkies maybe (these character names are extremely questionable)


Okay the DNA of each creature is as follows:

Zoinks:
+ Hunger level: depletes way faster than the jinkies ad the jeepers
+ Primary food hunters i.e. they actively are attracted to the objects in the "food" class
+ I'm thinking if it's possible for a zoink to interact with a food particle, eat half of that food particle, and then when a jinky interacts with that zoink, they get half of the food...the implementation isn't super clear in my head right now but I'm thinking a variable that alternates between two states...


Jinkies:
+ The protectors of the zoinks
+ Are actively trying to repel the jeepers from the zoinks and so they are attracted to the zoinks and repel the jeepers in an attempt to protect the zoinks
+ However, the jinkies are only able to repel the jeepers in phases, think of like time intervals where the protection variable is set to true for like 20 seconds and then for like 5 seconds,it's set to false
+ The jinkies need less food than the zoinks and they are unable to get the food directly from the food particles floating in the habitat but have to interact with the zoinks in order to get nourishment

Jeepers:

The way all the creatures react when they interact with the boundar is that they spawn on the opposing boundary because the way I visualize it, they're kind of stuck in a "circular" environment.
