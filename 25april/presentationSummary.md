# Presentation Summary

150-250 words: Write a summary of your presentation, including the discussion that followed your presentation.

My presentation was titled ['On Robots, Trust and Bias'](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vmvaffQWiOFEo1LiunooRmOfwNswQy6QNEKYJ4Im-IU/edit?usp=sharing) and in this presentation, I examined the relationship between trust and bias in robots and to what extent these factors play out in society by including real life examples of these factors at play.

I first focused on trust by putting forward a definition of trust in automation, in order to provide a uniform framework for our discussions. Then, I attempted to provide a contrast between the types of trust we as humans have in robots. By doing this, I focused on the observation that trust always has a social and operational context or environment, which was integral to our later discussions.

Then, I moved on to the bias factor and after putting forward a definition, provided real-life examples of AI bias and how it manifests in society. I also introduced the concept of explainable ai as a potential solution to reducing bias as well as the possible issues with it.

I concluded by linking these two factors as well as explaining why these discussions surrounding trust and bias in robots matter currently and in the near future.

The discussion were especially interesting as we examined the expanding role of robot researchers as well as possible solutions to the AI bias as a result of (in certain contexts) overtrust in AI. Furthermore, we explored possible solutions to algorithmic bias, whether or not we want to be rid of bias and the flipside of the argument: can robots trust us?
