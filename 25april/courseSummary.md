# Course Summary

Robota Psyche has definitely been one of the most insightful classes I've taken. Initially, my expectations for the class were more technical-geared, but as the course progressed, I was thoroughly immersed in the more theoretical aspects as well.

In the first weeks, we focused mainly on the technical aspects by exploring and broadening our knowledge on Processing. I found it especially interesting as I had taken Introduction to Interactive Media, which is also Processing-heavy in terms of content, but this was different. We weren't just learning the basics in isolation, we were combining all that we had learned and using that to simulate real-world situations. When the concept of ecosystems was first brought up, I was initially taken aback. How could something as biologically-connotated as an ecosystem have anything to do with the cold mechanical world of programming? The concept of programming these behaviours seemed so wild to me and I was fascinated by all we had learned and all we had made. We dealt with so many PVectors that at this point, I'm 95% certain that we're all Pvectors haha. But in all seriousness, seeing the way we would take a concept like gravity or schooling in fish or swarming, these lifelike behaviours, and attach them to circles or triangles and they would begin to behave like actual biological organisms was really amazing. It was in this course, that I had first encountered the term "emergent behaviour" and that really stuck with me as the idea of something existing that was not intentionally programmed, was such a new concept to me.
