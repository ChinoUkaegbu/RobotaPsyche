# Essay Proposal - On Robots and Ethical Decisions

Artificial intelligence

How can we be sure that artificially intelligent robots will make ethical decisions?

Unless there’s some extraneous subset of data that is used to “train” these robots, they have to rely on us, like human behaviours and we really aren’t that nice all the time

Even if we could find this dataset (think maybe a rule book with ideal human behavior), there’s the possibility that the robot moves towards unfamiliarity?
So we’re left with no choice but to rely on ourselves and our behaviours if the goal is to make robots more like us. But making the robots more like us means 
they also inherit the biases we have, the negative traits, everything, take the case of the Twitter bot for instance that was meant to be a friendly chatbot that would sound like a teenage girl and engage in light conversation with her followers on Twitter. However, within 24 hours she had been taken off the site because of her racist, sexist and anti-Semitic comments.

Also having to make ethical decisions like should you drive into the little child on the road or swerve into the wall to avoid the pedestrians while risking the life of the passengers

**Another angle is to think that some biases are what makes us human?** Like obviously not things like racism or sexism or what not but like (okay maybe bias isn’t a good word cause it has negative connotations) but like tendencies? **CAN BIASES BE UNLEARNED** or are they what makes us fundamentally human. If we are to evaluate every situation without bias, would we still be human beings? Is it because we would sacrifice some stranger in order to save a family member that we are human? **IS THE GOAL TO MAKE ROBOTS MORE LIKE HUMANS.** I feel like we’ll need to answer these two questions at some point. Also, **HAVE I MIXED UP BIAS WITH EMOTION**
